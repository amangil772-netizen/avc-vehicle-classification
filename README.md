## 🎯 What We Built

> Bradford Council spends **£15.30/hour × 2–3 officers × every junction** doing traffic counts by hand.
> We replaced that with a laptop, a camera, and this system.

The AVC&C system is a **real-time computer vision pipeline** that automatically detects, classifies, and counts vehicles passing a road junction — no GPU, no cloud, no personal data, no £50,000 ANPR contract.

```
📷 Camera Feed  →  🧠 YOLO11n  →  🔁 DeepSORT  →  📏 Trip-Line  →  📊 Dashboard
  (any source)     (detect)       (track IDs)     (count once)     (live charts)
```

**What it detects:** 🚗 Cars · 🚌 Buses · 🚛 Trucks

**What it ignores (by design):** faces · licence plates · individuals · personal data of any kind

**Where it runs:** your existing laptop — AMD Ryzen, no GPU needed

---

## 🔄 CDIO Journey

The project followed the **Conceive → Design → Implement → Operate** engineering lifecycle across 8 Agile sprints from September 2025 to April 2026.

<details>
<summary><strong>🔵 CONCEIVE — Sprints 1 & 2 &nbsp;|&nbsp; Sep–Nov 2025</strong></summary>

### What we did
- Met with Yunus Mayat at Bradford Council — understood the manual counting problem first-hand
- Compared YOLO v8 / v9 / v11 on CPU performance and accuracy → **YOLO11n selected**
- Researched 6 public datasets — none met UK weather requirements
- Decided to build a custom 11,582-image dataset via Roboflow across 5 weather conditions
- Set up GitHub, agreed team roles, configured branching strategy

### Key decision
> **No existing dataset covered Bradford's weather.** Rather than compromise on training data quality, we invested 25 hours of manual annotation to build the right dataset from scratch.

📄 **Full research:** `docs/AVC_G25_Research_Document.docx`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🟡 DESIGN — Sprints 3 & 4 &nbsp;|&nbsp; Nov 2025–Jan 2026</strong></summary>

### What we built
- `vehicle_counter.py` — core detection pipeline with COCO class filter [2, 5, 7]
- Virtual trip-line at y=300 with centroid-based directional crossing detection
- DeepSORT integration — persistent track IDs across occlusions
- Colour-coded bounding boxes: 🟢 car · 🔵 bus · 🟠 truck
- CSV logging schema: `timestamp, track_id, class, confidence, x, y, weather`

### The bug we had to fix
> Vehicles slowing near the trip-line were being counted 2–4× due to proximity triggering. We fixed this by storing **centroid history per track_id** — a count only registers on confirmed directional crossing, not proximity. After the fix: **48/48 manual count match**.

📄 **Full design:** `docs/AVC_G25_Design_Document.docx`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🟠 IMPLEMENT — Sprint 5 &nbsp;|&nbsp; Feb 2026</strong></summary>

### Training run
```
Model:    yolo11n.pt (COCO pretrained)
Dataset:  11,582 images | Normal/Rain/Fog/Snow/Sand
Epochs:   50  |  Batch: 8  |  imgsz: 640
Device:   CPU — AMD Ryzen 5 5600H
Duration: ~3 hours
Output:   runs/detect/avc_model_v15/weights/best.pt
```

### Results
```
mAP@0.5:   91.4%  ← target was 85%  ✅
Precision: 89.2%  ← target was 80%  ✅
Recall:    83.6%  ← target was 80%  ✅
FPS:       25     ← target was 15   ✅
```

### The path bug
> `data.yaml` kept failing because our folder was named `train data` (with a space). Fixed with raw string: `r'C:\Users\...\train data\data.yaml'`

📄 **Full results:** `docs/AVC_G25_Testing_Validation_Report.docx`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🟢 OPERATE — Sprints 6, 7 & 8 &nbsp;|&nbsp; Mar–Apr 2026</strong></summary>

### What we shipped
- `app.py` — Streamlit dashboard with Plotly bar/line charts, weather dropdown, 5s auto-refresh
- `start_demo.bat` — double-click to launch everything (for Bradford Council officers)
- UA-DETRAC benchmark validation by Pratham — confirmed results on external dataset
- Full GDPR audit — 200 CSV rows reviewed, 0 personal data found
- DroidCam phone-as-webcam integration for live exhibition demo
- A1 exhibition poster, demo plan, all documentation

### Key Technical Decisions

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| **YOLO11n nano** over larger models | 25 FPS on CPU — no GPU needed at Bradford Council |
| **Centroid history** for counting | Prevents double-counting when vehicles decelerate near trip-line |
| **COCO class filter [2,5,7]** | Architecturally blocks all non-vehicle classes — privacy enforcement |
| **DeepSORT** over ByteTrack/SORT | Best tracking accuracy vs CPU overhead balance |
| **Streamlit** over Flask/Dash | Python-native — Council officers need zero HTML/JS knowledge |
| **Append-mode CSV** | Data never lost if counter restarts mid-session |
| **5 weather conditions** in training | Bradford's climate demands fog/rain/snow robustness |

## ⚖️ Ethics & GDPR

### Privacy by Design

This system was built with privacy as a **hard architectural constraint**, not an afterthought.

```
What the system DOES store:          What the system NEVER stores:
─────────────────────────────        ──────────────────────────────
✅ timestamp                         ❌ video frames
✅ vehicle class (car/bus/truck)     ❌ facial data
✅ anonymised track_id (session)     ❌ licence plates
✅ confidence score                  ❌ individual identities
✅ centroid x, y position            ❌ anything transmitted externally
✅ weather condition
```

**Verification:** 200 CSV rows manually audited — **0 instances of personal data found.**

### CDEI AI Assurance Framework

| Principle | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Safety & Security | ✅ Compliant | Local processing, no network exposure |
| Transparency | ✅ Compliant | FAIR Report, open-source codebase |
| Fairness | ✅ Compliant | Tested across 5 weather conditions equally |
| Accountability | ✅ Compliant | Clear team ownership, supervisor oversight |
| Contestability | ✅ Compliant | Auditable CSV, explainable dashboard |
